# Electronics Transistor Projects

## Overview

This repository contains two of the projects I worked on for a class. The task of the projects were to create a circuit that uses at least one transistor. The transistor must be properly biased and the circuit must work.

### Fall Semester Project

During the Fall semester, the transistor we used for the project was a BJT transistor. We used it to create a logical NOT gate, also known as an inverter. This circuit also contains a rectifier stage that simulated the electricity coming from a normal wall outlet. For our testing we only used a function generator as it was safer that connecting to the wall. We also used a power supply to verify the inverter was working before putting both stages together.

### Spring Semester Project

During the Spring semester, the circuit we designed was a half adder using CMOS transistors. This was because each CMOS pair is matched to each other, making troubleshooting and biasing of the circuit easier. To power the circuit we used a current mirror that biased all the transistors in our circuit. The output of the circuit were two LEDs to show the Carry bit and the Sum bit.
